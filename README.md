## Abstract
This study focuses on the stability analysis of dynamic systems of integer and fractional orders using Lyapunov functions, a widely used method in control theory and dynamic system modeling. The research includes both theoretical analysis and practical applications of Lyapunov function synthesis for systems of different orders. 

The first part introduces fundamental concepts related to the Lyapunov method and stability of dynamic systems. Classical modeling formalisms such as Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian approaches are discussed, along with optimization of energy functions in linear systems. Special attention is given to quadratic Lyapunov function optimization and its role in stability analysis.

Next, theoretical foundations of fractional-order calculus are presented, enabling the modeling of memory-dependent systems. Definitions using Riemann-Liouville, Caputo, and Grünwald-Letnikov approaches are described, alongside numerical tools such as MATLAB and Simulink for implementing fractional-order systems and analyzing their stability using Lyapunov functions.

A comparison of Lyapunov functions for integer- and fractional-order systems is presented. Three synthesis methods were developed and tested:
1. **Classical Lyapunov function method** – applying standard Lyapunov functions to fractional-order systems.
2. **Simplex optimization method** – numerical optimization of the cost functional.
3. **Conditional Lyapunov function optimization method** – selecting functions that satisfy the negative derivative criterion.

Numerical experiments evaluated the effectiveness of each method in stabilizing switched systems. The results show that selecting an appropriate Lyapunov function for fractional-order systems is crucial for effective stability analysis and control.
